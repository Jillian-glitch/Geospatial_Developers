# Spectral Indices





## 2. Course overview

Spectral Indices are combinations of spectral reflectance from two or more wavelengths that indicate the relative abundance of features of interest. There are different indices for vegetation, built-up features, water and burned areas.
In this section we will have hands-on tutorial exploring some vegetation indices in the Google Earth Engine environment.<br>
