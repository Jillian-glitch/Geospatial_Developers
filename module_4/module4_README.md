## Introduction

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earthâ€™s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

## Objectives

The main objective is to train GIS and Remote Sensing Experts  in the basics of satellite image
processing in the [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/) Environment by leveraging on the Google Earth
high-resolution imagery and the GEE cloud-based data processing capacities for land use
mapping, spatiotemporal analysis on forest monitoring and cartographic visualization.
